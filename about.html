			Why do we as humans get so attached to inanimate things? But more importantly, how are these bonds being formed?
			<br><br>
			“Self –” is a digital community archive of stories that reflects the bonds we build with “objects”. 
			<br><br>
			This archive exists as a way for people to gain a deeper perspective on how their own thoughts and memories are being reflected through the “objects” that they are attached to.
