				“I used this <span id="callout">journal</span> almost every day throughout my freshman year of college. It's sort of like a time capsule for me — I can see from my perspective as a young, naïve 18 year old. I wrote about my good days, my bad days, and everything in between, and this journal contains some of my most honest thoughts. 
				<br><br>
				Recently, I read through this journal to reflect on my time in college after submitting my final undergraduate thesis. I'm proud to see the growth and development I've had over the years, and I'm sure there is much more growth to come.”<a href="alisha.html"><sup>{ 1 }</sup></a>
