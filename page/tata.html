				“This was the second <span id="callout">Nintendo DS </span> system that I owned and the one that I have the most vivid memory of.

				I remember crying after my brother defeated me in a pokemon battle in Pokemon Pearl, the first Pokemon game I played.<a href="ali.html"><sup>{1}</sup></a>
				<br><br>
				I remember constantly going to the game store in the shopping mall close to home for new DS games that were pirated.
				<br><br>
				I remember looking forward to playing with my DS after a day in elementary school.
				<br><br>
				I remember having the most fun with friends with this particular Nintendo DS. We would play games together (Pokemon, Mario Kart, Tamagochi DS game) and comparing the progress we made in those games.”<a href="anson.html"><sup>{2}</sup></a>
