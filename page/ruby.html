				“I fell in love with the stone Ruby when I first saw in on a jewelry catalogue, going as far as making my parents call me Ruby at home, so when I saw it in person for the first time I was obsessed with it. I begged my parents to buy it for me. After a long time of persuasion, they finally said yes.

				Since I got that <span id="callout">necklace,</span> I wear it almost every day for the past 12 years. Ruby isn’t my real name, but I feel like it grew on me, and the necklace reminds me of the person I want to become. It’s a persona I had as a kid and I feel I’ve slowly become this persona I set out to be.<a href="alisha.html"><sup>{ 1 }</sup></a>  The necklace reminds me of that and I also use it as a lucky charm and calming tool during difficult times.”
