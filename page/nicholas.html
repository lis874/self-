				“Every time I travel out of the country I get a piece of art done by a local artist representing some of the local culture and usually in the local art form.<a href="maddie.html"><sup>{ 1 }</sup></a> Typically these pieces remind me of the trip and the particular place I visited, but the <span id="callout">Moroccan piece</span> that I am showing here has particular value to me due to the fact that the trip that it was purchased on was with some of my closest friends participating in some of the most unique activities I have enjoyed to date. 
				<br><br>
				Everything about this particular portrait has a story, from the purchase, to the transportation, to the framing... not only does a painting remind me of the adventures of the travel, but the painting in of itself has created additional memories for my friends and me.”<a href="tata.html"><sup>{ 2 }</sup>
