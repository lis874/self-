				“It was a gift from my mother when I was going through a hard time. The symbol on the <span id="callout">necklace</span> is of the third eye chakra and growing up my mom was very spiritual and performed spiritual cleansings on me whenever I was down. I was in America at the time so she got me this necklace to remind me to align with my spiritual side whenever I need guidance or feel blocked.”<a href="ruby.html"><sup>{ 1 }</sup></a>
