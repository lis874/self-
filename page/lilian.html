				“When I had to move to college, an item I took with me was my <span id="callout"> yellow squared throw pillow.</span> You know the saying “always bring a piece of home everywhere you go”? Well I did that with my  pillow. 
				<br><br>
				From the earliest memories, I remember always having that pillow on my bed and even now I have to have it on my bed or else I can’t really fall asleep. It’s my primary pillow for everything like sleeping, lounging, hugging, crying, etc. 
				<br><br>
				A lot of people don’t really realize how many emotions we can feel in a particular space all at one time.<a href="meme.html"><sup>{1}</sup></a> When it come to the fabric and stuffing of the pillow is super soft and cushiony which gaves it a nice feeling of comfort and a warming sensation. But the smell reminded	me of the times when the house wasn’t stable or reminded me of certain people and moments of time. That’s why I love it so much, it’s an object that brings so many different emotions all at once, the good and the bad, but yet can be so comforting at times, but really it’s a reminder of how much has changed over time.”<a href="maria.html"><sup>{2}</sup></a>
