				“So I bought it myself at Ross. I had to buy clothes that were more “conservative” for my trip because rules I guess and I bought this. It was just a <span id="callout">cute dress</span> at first no real attachment was given to it. During the trip I met my boyfriend of now 4 years. And a couple months into dating he told me that the moment he fell in love with me I was wearing this dress. And now I can’t find myself to give it away. It doesn’t go with my current style but I can’t part with it.”<a href="aldrin.html"><sup>{1}</sup></a>
