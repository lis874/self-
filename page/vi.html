				“It was my <span id="callout">18th birthday present</span> from my father. It was the first present I had received for my birthday in 18 years. I come from a family that believes not much in material possessions, but rather in value of growing money. 
				<br><br>
				Every year on my birthday, ever since I was born, I received a small some of money that would be put into a bank account just for me that I still do not have access to. But for my 18th it was a present I least expected to commend me for my patience and appreciation for quality over quantity (as told by my father who obviously portrays me as way better a person that I believe I am).<a href="manuel.html"><sup>{1}</sup></a> This object is something I value extremely and see myself passing it down through generations like my father who received a watch from his father and he will give to my brother.”
