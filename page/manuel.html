				“My <span id="callout">violin</span> was sold to me by my violin teacher here in Toronto who plays in the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. She could’ve sold it at a dealer and made a lot more money off of it, but instead she wanted to sell it to someone she knew and that she knew would take care of it.<a href="trudy.html"><sup>{ 1 }</sup></a> This teacher was one of the main reasons why I’m able to study music on a post-secondary level today.”
