				“They exist as a promise I made to my God. There’s three of them; 
				<br><br>
				1. One that I received as my original ring, which says; “I will wait for my beloved”.
				<br><br>
				2. One that exists as a placeholder for a wedding ring.
				<br><br>
				3. One that I wear with the placeholder ring that has the word “eternity” inscribed in it. My sister and I made it this past year as a reminder during these difficult times of the coming fulfillment of God’s promise of the future.
				<br><br>
				<span id="callout">These rings</span> are more than a purity ring to me, they stand as an oath I swore when I turned away from my old life’s choices.<a href="aldrin.html"><sup>{ 1 }</sup></a> I do not get attached to physical things almost ever but these are special to me.”
