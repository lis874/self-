				“It’s just always been here. I used to have a tiny bed. Before I went to bed I would move my pillows on my table or else I had no place to sleep.<a href="lilian.html"><sup>{1}</sup></a> But <span id="callout">my shark </span>helped me to fall asleep quicker, so I keep him with me under the blanket. 
				<br><br>
				There was a period of time that I hated my stuffed animals, because I was confused with my life. I didn’t know what I want, the stuffed animals just looked way too happy, I wanted them to be as miserable as I was. But my shark always looks grumpy as hell, but he is so soft I could hold him and he will comfort me in a way. I changed a lot during college, I changed very fast and very drastically, I’ve never experienced this kind of change. My shark is sort of witnessing the change of me but he is always there, not changing.”
