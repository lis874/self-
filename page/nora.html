				“My grandmother bought <span id="callout">the dolls </span> for me and my sister when we were born, so I’ve had them literally as long as I’ve been alive. She bought one doll for each of us, but somewhere along the way, I took possession of my sister’s and never gave it back.<a href="trudy.html"><sup>{1}</sup></a> They’re called Kaleigh and Nora, after my sister and I (very original, I know), but are known as baby dolls in general. I tried to change the names when I was little, but nothing else stuck. Kaleigh and I are the only ones who can tell the dolls apart, mirroring our childhood when strangers could not tell us apart, though we’ve never looked much a like.
				<br><br> 
				I’ve slept with them every night that I can remember, with few exceptions, which Kaleigh still mocks me for, but aside from her and my parents, they’re the only things I have that I can say have been in my life as long as I’ve been here. They started off all pink and soft, but they’ve been through a lot and there’s a lot holding them together right now. I’ve had to keep with seeing them to prevent them from completely falling apart, but it’s been 21 years and I just can’t let anything happen to them.”
