				“My best friend who is like my sister gave me this <span id="callout"> bracelet</span> on my 17th birthday.<a href="vi.html"><sup>{1}</sup></a> I haven’t removed it from my wrist since. It was significant because it was a piece she gave me before I left to college in NYC.
				<br><br>
				Unfortunately, we are now on opposite sides of the world and because of the time difference and our busy schedules we don’t speak everyday. However, when we do whether it be after a few days or months, everything feels like we got back right where we left off. I have a few pieces of jewellery that friends have given me that I've worn since i have received them. But this is one of the pieces I’ve had the longest and has the most significance. On my hard days it reminds me of our friendship and the support shes had for and still gives me.<a href="wallis.html"><sup>{2}</sup></a> Despite being far apart in distance she has always been there for me through my ups and downs and has been a reminder to breathe and get through tough situations.”
